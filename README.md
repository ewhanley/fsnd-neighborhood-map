# Project 5: Neighborhood Map

This project uses the [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) framework's MVVM pattern. The project uses the Google Maps API, Google Street View API, and Foursquare API to display interactive data about breweries located in Missoula, Montana, USA. Both the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Slideout.js](https://slideout.js.org/) libraries were used to construct this SPA. The CSS Grid Layout is used to render the app responsively for different screen sizes and orientations. The app is bundled for deployment with a [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) plus [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) build system.
